# Gis_Portfolio

## Introduction
Welcome to my GIS portfolio! This repository showcases my proficiency in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) using ArcGis and QGIS. I currently have two significant projects that demonstrate my skills and expertise in Geographic Information Systems (GIS). Each project demonstrates my skills in spatial analysis, data visualization, and problem-solving using GIS tools and techniques. Feel free to explore the details of each project and the codebase associated with them. <br/>

## Project 1: Study Area Maps
Overview
The "Study Area Maps" project focuses on creating detailed and informative maps for specific study areas. These maps serve various purposes, including visualizing geographical features, analyzing land use patterns, and providing essential context for research and decision-making. The Maps were created using ArcGis and Qgis

Key Features
Thematic Layers: Incorporating thematic layers to highlight specific features relevant to the study, such as topography, infrastructure, and environmental factors.

Data Integration: Integrating diverse datasets to create comprehensive maps that offer a holistic view of the study area.

Cartographic Design: Employing effective cartographic design principles to ensure clarity, readability, and visual appeal.

Interactive Elements: Developing interactive maps to enhance user engagement and exploration of the study area.

### Examples of the Study Are Maps

## Project 2: Conflict Health Geoanalysis of Borno State
### Overview
The "Conflict Health Geoanalysis of Borno State" project delves into the intersection of conflict zones and public health in Borno State, Nigeria. Using GIS, this analysis aims to understand the spatial distribution of health facilities in conflict-affected areas, identify accessibility challenges, and propose informed solutions.

### Key Features
Spatial Analysis: Conducting spatial analysis to identify patterns and correlations between conflict zones and health facility distribution.

Accessibility Mapping: Creating maps that visualize the accessibility of health facilities in conflict-affected areas, highlighting gaps and potential areas for improvement.

Impact Assessment: Assessing the impact of conflict on public health infrastructure and identifying strategies to enhance healthcare services in challenging environments.

Data-driven Insights: Utilizing data-driven insights to inform policy recommendations and interventions for improving healthcare delivery in conflict zones.

### How to Explore
