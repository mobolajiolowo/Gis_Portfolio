# Background
Borno State, one of Nigeria’s federating units, which prides itself as the “Home of Peace”, has been in the news 
since July 2009 for the wrong reasons. The typical headlines on and about the state are coordinated and 
uncoordinated bombings, sporadic gun battles, raiding of police stations, targeted killings, drive-by shootings, 
etc. All of these were unknown to the state and seemed distant until the 2009 insurgency mounted by the 
extremist Islamist sect, Jama’atu Ahis Sunna Lidda’awati Wal-Jihad, referred to in common parlance as Boko 
Haram
In the region of Borno, the health system has suffered significant deterioration due to ongoing conflict. Primary 
care services are inadequate, referrals are difficult to make, and hospitals are overwhelmed with patients. As a 
result, the local population has limited access to healthcare services.
The overall situation in Borno highlights the urgent need for comprehensive and improved healthcare 
intervention and optimized resource distribution.
I am pleased to present to you the report on the spatial analysis conducted to guide interventions aimed at 
improving access to healthcare services in Borno State. The analysis utilized various datasets, including conflict 
data, health facilities data, population density data, and administrative boundaries. The objective was to 
understand the distribution of facilities in high-risk areas, assess the risk profile of different population groups, 
and optimize resource allocation for healthcare intervention.

# Analysis and Findings

## 1. Distribution of Conflicts in the State

This represents the distribution of the conflicts in the state with their extremity. It gives a picture of areas with 
more violent conflict events. Health Facilities in areas like this are more prone to disruptions and destructions 
than others.

## 3. Hotspot of Borno Conflict  
Using the Kernel Density, this analysis identifies areas with a higher density and concentration of conflict events 
showcasing conflict hotspot locations in the state. LGs like Chibok, Maiduguri, gwoza, Jere, Nganzai would need 
more security resources than others.
